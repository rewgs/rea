# A collection of hopefully useful Reaper scripts.
Note:
- Files in `scripts` are meant to be called by the user.
- Files in `modules` are referenced by the files in `scripts`, and thus are not intended to be touched by the user.

# Installation: 
- Install the Ultraschall API -- it's a required dependency.
- Download this repo and place it in your `REAPER/Scripts` folder. 
    - The full path should be `REAPER/Scripts/rewgs-reaper-scripts`.
    - Note that the downloaded .zip might be called something other than `rewgs-reaper-scripts,` such as `rewgs-reaper-scripts-main`. If so, rename it to `rewgs-reaper-scripts` prior to copying it to `REAPER/Scripts`.
