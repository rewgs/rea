A collection of hopefully useful Reaper scripts.

Files in `scripts` are meant to be called by the user.
Files in `modules` are referenced by the files in `scripts`, and thus are not intended to be touched by the user.

Installation: 
- Install the Ultraschall API -- it's a required dependency.
- Download this repo and place it in your `REAPER/Scripts` folder. The full path should be `REAPER/Scripts/rewgs`.
