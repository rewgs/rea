# Rea - Rewgs' Collection of Hopefully Useful Reaper Scripts

Formerly called `rewgs-reaper-scripts`. Powered by [reaify](https://github.com/rewgs/reaify).

## Notes

Files in `scripts` are meant to be called by the user.
Files in `modules` are referenced by the files in `scripts`, and thus are not intended to be touched by the user.

**Be sure to check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).**

# Installation
- Install the Ultraschall API -- it's a required dependency.
- Download this repo and place it in your `REAPER/Scripts` folder. 
    - The full path should be `REAPER/Scripts/rea`.
    - **Note that the downloaded .zip might be called something other than `rea`, such as `rea-main`.** If so, rename it to `rea` prior to copying it to `REAPER/Scripts`.
