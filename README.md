A collection of hopefully useful Reaper scripts.

Files in `reaper-scripts` are meant to be called by the user.
Files in `modules` are shared functions and whatnot, utilized by the files in `reaper-scripts`, and are not intended to be touched by the user.

Installation: download this repo and place it in your `REAPER/Scripts` folder. The full path should be `REAPER/Scripts/rewgs`.
