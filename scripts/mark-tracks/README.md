no mark = no one touches/works on it

# replacements
- to record = "REC"
- to transcribe = "TR" (implies "REC")
- to improve = "IM" -- needs producer, writer, engineer, etc to make it better in some way

# Key bindings
REC: F1
TR:  F2
IM:  F3


# todo:

- split "REC" into:
    - to record ensemble = "R-E"
    - to record soloist = "R-S"
- Key chording: Ctrl+m ...
    + re
    + rs
    + t
